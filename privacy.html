      <p>
        Chinese pi is a Testnet application built on the Pi Network platform.
        This application is provided for testing and development purposes only.

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>

      </p>

      <h2>Data Storage</h2>
      <p>
        No personal data is permanently stored on external servers. Any local

      </p>

      <h2>Payments</h2>
      <p>
        All payments processed through this application are Testnet payments
        using Test-Pi. These transactions have no real-world value.

        This app uses the Pi Network SDK and related Pi Network services. No other
